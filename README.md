## Introduction
The Music Booking API project is designed to assess my ability to build a scalable, efficient, and secure backend system for managing artists, events, and bookings. 
It evaluates my expertise in API design, database optimization, and asynchronous processing to handle complex user interactions. 
The project also tests my ability to implement role-based access control, ensuring secure and seamless interactions between artists and event organizers. 
Additionally, it examines my approach to data validation, error handling, and enforcing business rules to maintain system integrity. 
My skills in real-time data updates, pagination, and query optimization are also being assessed. 
The API's architecture must support high traffic loads, ensuring fast response times and smooth user experiences. 
Furthermore, my ability to write comprehensive documentation and collaborate effectively to deliver a production-ready system is a key aspect of the evaluation.

## The Task
So, you are to create a service for the Music Booking App that does this:
* Develop an API that manages artist profiles, event listings, and booking transactions 🎤🎟️.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between artists, event organizers, and admin users 🔑.
* Design and optimize a scalable database schema using MongoDB (Mongoose) to efficiently store user and booking data 🗄️.
* Ensure secure authentication and authorization using JWT and password hashing for user protection 🔒.
* Build API endpoints that allow users to:
  (a) Create and manage artist profiles 🎭.
  (b) List and book events 📅.
  (c) View and update booking statuses ✅.
* Implement pagination and filtering for efficient data retrieval and better performance 📊.
* Enforce rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse and ensure data integrity 🚧.
* Deploy the API with comprehensive documentation and provide a Postman collection for testing 📜.
* Achieve a benchmark score of 90/100 by following best practices in API design, security, and scalability 🏆.
